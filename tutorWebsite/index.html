        <h1><i>Interesting things about me:</i> some interesting things</h1>
        <p>
          In 8th grade I decieded that I was very interested in math, 
          and resolved to learn all that I could in order to attempt to place out of a grade or two
          of math. I self studied Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus (and a bit of calculus too) and was 
          able to place out of those classes. The time I spent learning those subjects was very enjoyable.
          I think that in teaching myself these subjects I gained more out of them than I could by simply 
          sitting in a classroom listening to lectures. For me it was in doing problems and diagnosing 
          specific material that I didn't understand that I was able to grow and learn. I want to now
          help others gain their own understanding of math.
