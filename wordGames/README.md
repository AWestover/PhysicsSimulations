# wordGames
Some programs that can help you play a word game or 2 perfectly (it can be used as a dictionary, or for the game ghost). It is just some really simple python CLIs that get the job done. 

Lots of thanks to this github repo: [https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary)

I got the dictionary json thing from that github project
